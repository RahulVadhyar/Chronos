/** \file stlheader.hpp

 \brief Contains all the standard library headers used in the project

 This file is included in all the source files of the project.
 It contains all the standard library headers used in the project.
 This is done to reduce the number of includes in the source files and to make the source files more readable.
 This also makes it easier to add new standard library headers to the project.
 It also makes it simple to know which standard library headers are used in the project.
